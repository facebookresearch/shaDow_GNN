## Organization

This directory contains the `*.yml` configuration files to reproduce the shaDow-GNN results in the paper (Table 1, 2, 3). 

We use the followng naming convention for the file names: `<backbone-GNN>_<layers>_<sampler>.yml`. For example: `sage_3_ppr.yml` is for a 3-layer shaDow-SAGE with the PPR sampler.
